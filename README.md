To set everything up, clone repo and make sure that Go is installed on machine. I built this using go1.11.4, but I think go1 in general will work fine. I did not compile my JS with Babel, so if using older browsers that do not support ES6, things will probably break.

Once the is above is done, make the "build.sh" file executable and run it. It does not do much, so you can additionally run the server via `go build *.go` and running the executable.
